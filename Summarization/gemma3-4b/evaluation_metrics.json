The winged craft, lifted by a solid-fuel booster, climbed to an altitude of 70 kilometers before gliding back to a controlled splashdown in the Bay of Bengal. Engineers say the data gathered from this flight will shape the design of a larger vehicle capable of cutting launch costs by more than 50 percent. The mission, which lasted just under 15 minutes, is seen as a key milestone in India's effort to compete in the global commercial launch market. Officials stressed that at least half a dozen more tests will be needed before a full-scale demonstration, but called the debut \"a major step toward low-cost access to space.\"",

The system recreates equipment such as oscilloscopes, beakers and lasers in a 3D environment where users can tweak variables and observe outcomes. Educators say the tool is especially valuable for schools that lack fully equipped labs or must share limited resources among large classes. Early pilots indicate that students using the simulations demonstrate stronger conceptual understanding on follow-up tests. Critics caution that virtual labs should supplement rather than replace hands-on experience with real materials whenever possible.",

Advocacy groups that brought the case argue that lax moderation disproportionately harmed women, LGBTQ users and people of color.
