The winged craft, lifted by a solid-fuel booster, climbed to an altitude of 70 kilometers before gliding back to a controlled splashdown in the Bay of Bengal. Engineers say the data gathered from this flight will shape the design of a larger vehicle capable of cutting launch costs by more than 50 percent. The mission, which lasted just under 15 minutes, is seen as a key milestone in India's effort to compete in the global commercial launch market. Officials stressed that at least half a dozen more tests will be needed before a full-scale demonstration, but called the debut \"a major step toward low-cost access to space.\"",
