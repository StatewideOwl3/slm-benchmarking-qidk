Investigators documented years of deferred maintenance, understaffing and inadequate driver training that, they say, contributed directly to preventable accidents. The report describes a culture in which employees feared retaliation for speaking up about mechanical issues or schedule pressures. In response, the transport ministry announced an immediate audit of all major lines and pledged new funding for track upgrades and signaling systems.

Smartphone operating systems now include detailed dashboards showing how long kids spend on specific apps, with customizable limits and downtime schedules. Several startups are also marketing \"digital chore charts\" that reward reading, outdoor play or household tasks with tokens redeemable for extra game time. Child psychologists caution that technology alone cannot replace clear communication and consistent rules at home, but say transparency can reduce conflicts. Privacy advocates, meanwhile, are urging companies to avoid turning children's behavioral data into yet another source of targeted advertising.\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
