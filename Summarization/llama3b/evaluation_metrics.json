The winged craft, lifted by a solid-fuel booster, climbed to an altitude of 70 kilometers before gliding back to a controlled splashdown in the Bay of Bengal. Engineers say the data gathered from this flight will shape the design of a larger vehicle capable of cutting launch costs by more than 50 percent. The mission, which lasted just under 15 minutes, is seen as a key milestone in India's effort to compete in the global commercial launch market. Officials stressed that at least half a dozen more tests will be needed before a full-scale demonstration, but called the debut \"a major step toward low-cost access to space.\"",

The review found that many courses were poorly aligned with local labor market needs, focusing on generic skills rather than specific qualifications sought by employers. Participants frequently reported difficulty securing apprenticeships or interviews after completing the modules. In response, the labor ministry has frozen funding for underperforming providers and pledged to consult industry bodies more closely when designing future curricula. Opposition lawmakers are calling for greater transparency on which contractors benefited from the program and how results will be tracked going forward.",
