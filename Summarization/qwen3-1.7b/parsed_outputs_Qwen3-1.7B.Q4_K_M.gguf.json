The user wants a concise summary of the article. First, I need to identify the key points. The main points are the Supreme Court's decision classifying gig workers as employees, the legal challenges from unions, the court's reasoning about control over working conditions, the industry and labor groups' reactions, and the upcoming regulatory efforts.\n\nI need to make sure the summary is in a few sentences and starts with \"ANSWER\". I should avoid any extra commentary and just present the facts. Let me check the details: the court in a European nation, unanimous decision, classification as employees, unions' arguments about minimum wage and benefits, the court's finding about control over hours, pricing, and metrics, industry warnings about costs, labor advocates' support, and lawmakers drafting regulations. \n\nI need to condense this into a few sentences without losing any crucial info. Also, the European nation's name isn't specified, so maybe just mention the court without the country name? The user might want to keep it general. Let me structure it: the court ruled gig workers are employees, unions argued for protections, the court found platforms have control, leading to classification, industry groups say it'll raise costs, labor advocates support, lawmakers are",

The move comes after student groups and alumni raised concerns about the societal impact of technologies ranging from facial recognition to autonomous weapons. New modules will cover topics such as bias in algorithms, data privacy, climate responsibility and responsible innovation. Faculty members from the humanities and social sciences will co-teach alongside engineers to encourage interdisciplinary thinking. Administrators say they hope graduates will be better prepared to anticipate unintended consequences before products reach the market.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Cameras and inductive loops embedded in the roadways estimate vehicle volumes and pedestrian flows, allowing algorithms to reduce idle time at intersections.

The user wants a summary of the article. The key points are: a conservation group created an app for citizen science, hikers and villagers can document endangered species sightings with their phones. They can take photos, record audio, and log GPS coords even offline. When they connect, they upload the data. Biologists verify it, used to update habitats maps. In areas with no professional surveys, it's a early warning for poaching. Also, locations of vulnerable animals are kept confidential to prevent misuse.\n\nI need to make sure the summary is concise, starts with ANSWER, and is a few sentences. Let me check the article again to ensure I didn't miss any important details. The app is called something, but the article doesn't mention the name. The organization is mentioned as a conservation group, but the name isn't given. So I should keep it general. Also, the part about the data being confidential is important for preventing misuse. Need to include that. Let me structure it: the app allows users to submit data, biologists verify, used for updating maps, early warning system, and confidentiality to prevent misuse. That's a few sentences. Make sure it's accurate and not too wordy. Alright, that",
