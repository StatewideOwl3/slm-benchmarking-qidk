The review found that many courses were poorly aligned with local labor market needs, focusing on generic skills rather than specific qualifications sought by employers. Participants frequently reported difficulty securing apprenticeships or interviews after completing the modules. In response, the labor ministry has frozen funding for underperforming providers and pledged to consult industry bodies more closely when designing future curricula. Opposition lawmakers are calling for greater transparency on which contractors benefited from the program and how results will be tracked going forward.",
