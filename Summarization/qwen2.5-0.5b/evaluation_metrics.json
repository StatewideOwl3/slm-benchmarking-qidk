The winged craft, lifted by a solid-fuel booster, climbed to an altitude of 70 kilometers before gliding back to a controlled splashdown in the Bay of Bengal. Engineers say the data gathered from this flight will shape the design of a larger vehicle capable of cutting launch costs by more than 50 percent. The mission, which lasted just under 15 minutes, is seen as a key milestone in India's effort to compete in the global commercial launch market. Officials stressed that at least half a dozen more tests will be needed before a full-scale demonstration, but called the debut \"a major step toward low-cost access to space.\"",

The world, slightly larger than Earth, is believed to have once hosted a thick, volatile-rich envelope that was gradually stripped away by stellar radiation.

Farmers are shifting from water-intensive rice to salt-tolerant millets and pulses, supported by agronomists from a nearby university. Homes damaged by repeated cyclones are being rebuilt on raised plinths, with reinforced roofs and simple rainwater harvesting systems. Local women have formed self-help groups to manage emergency savings and distribute relief supplies when storms hit. Though many families have migrated inland for work, community leaders say the changes have reduced losses from recent floods and given villagers a stronger voice in regional planning.\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable\nerable",

The study, published in the journal Social Science & Medicine, found that people who use social media to promote positive change are more likely to be motivated by positive emotions and less likely to be influenced by negative emotions. The study also found that people who use social media to promote positive change are more likely to engage in positive behaviors, such as volunteering and donating. The study suggests that social media can be a powerful tool for promoting positive change, but that it is important to use it in a responsible and ethical way.\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE\nLETE",

Using aerial laser scanning, researchers mapped subtle changes in elevation that revealed geometric patterns of ditches and raised platforms. Elders from nearby villages recognized the shapes as similar to designs in traditional art and oral histories describing ancestral settlements. Excavations at select sites uncovered pottery shards, tools and charred plant remains, offering new insights into precolonial land management. Team members emphasize that local knowledge was crucial to interpreting the data and deciding where to dig.",

The study, published in the journal Nature, found that the AI system could be used to predict the number of people who would be homeless in a given area. The researchers used data from the United States Census Bureau to create a model that could predict the number of people who would be homeless in a given area. The model was then tested on a dataset of 100,000 locations in the United States. The researchers found that the model was able to accurately predict the number of people who would be homeless in a given area with a 90% accuracy rate. The researchers also found that the model could be used to predict the number of people who would be homeless in a given area with a 95% accuracy rate.
