The new route connects densely populated suburbs to the city center, cutting travel times that once stretched beyond two hours down to less than 40 minutes. Officials say the line, which runs mostly underground, will help ease chronic traffic congestion and reduce emissions from diesel buses. Construction was plagued by cost overruns, corruption investigations and technical setbacks, leading many residents to doubt it would ever be completed. On opening day, however, packed trains and busy platforms suggested strong demand for the long-awaited service.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Conservationists removed drainage canals, replanted native reeds and restricted new construction in the area, which had long been used as an informal dumping ground. Seasonal flooding has gradually reestablished shallow pools that serve as feeding grounds for herons, ducks and other waterfowl. Local residents, once skeptical of the project, now frequent newly built boardwalks and viewing decks that offer close-up views of wildlife. City officials say the wetland also acts as a natural sponge, absorbing excess rainwater and reducing flood risk downstream.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The study, published in the journal Nature, found that the AI system could be used to predict the number of people who would be homeless in a given area. The researchers used data from the United States Census Bureau to create a model that could predict the number of people who would be homeless in a given area. The model was then tested on a dataset of 100,000 locations in the United States. The researchers found that the model was able to accurately predict the number of people who would be homeless in a given area with a 90% accuracy rate.

Prosecutors allege that executives diverted sponsorship money into shell companies, falsified expense reports and awarded contracts to relatives. Witnesses testified that whistleblowers who questioned irregularities were sidelined or forced out. In response to the scandal, the government has suspended public funding for the federation and appointed an interim committee to oversee reforms. Athletes, many of whom trained for years under the tainted leadership, say they hope the cleanup will lead to more transparent selection processes and fair distribution of resources.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
