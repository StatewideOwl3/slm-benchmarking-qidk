The winged craft, lifted by a solid-fuel booster, climbed to an altitude of 70 kilometers before gliding back to a controlled splashdown in the Bay of Bengal. Engineers say the data gathered from this flight will shape the design of a larger vehicle capable of cutting launch costs by more than 50 percent. The mission, which lasted just under 15 minutes, is seen as a key milestone in India's effort to compete in the global commercial launch market. Officials stressed that at least half a dozen more tests will be needed before a full-scale demonstration, but called the debut \"a major step toward low-cost access to space.\"",

The material, derived from plant residues like rice husks and sugarcane bagasse, is processed into yarns that resemble cotton but break down more quickly under specific conditions. Designers working with the company are experimenting with simple, timeless silhouettes to encourage longer wear before garments are returned for recycling or composting. Environmental groups have praised the concept but note that scalable collection systems will be crucial to prevent items from simply ending up in landfills. The firm has partnered with select retailers to pilot in-store take-back bins and detailed care labels explaining how to dispose of products responsibly.",

The modified planes use a combination of traditional jet fuel and battery-powered motors during takeoff and landing, when emissions and noise are highest. Engineers say early flights suggest fuel savings of up to 30 percent on segments under 300 kilometers. Regulators are overseeing the trials closely to evaluate safety and reliability before certifying the technology for wider use. Environmental advocates welcome the initiative but stress that broader changes in travel patterns and investment in rail alternatives will also be necessary to curb aviation-related emissions.",

The review found that many courses were poorly aligned with local labor market needs, focusing on generic skills rather than specific qualifications sought by employers. Participants frequently reported difficulty securing apprenticeships or interviews after completing the modules. In response, the labor ministry has frozen funding for underperforming providers and pledged to consult industry bodies more closely when designing future curricula.
