    "model_answer": "The experimental housing project on the edge of a North American city is demonstrating how 3D-printed concrete structures could speed up construction and cut costs. Using a large robotic arm, builders extruded layers of cement-based material to form the walls of small single-story homes in a matter of days. The printed shells were then fitted with conventional roofs, windows and electrical systems. Early residents, selected from low-income families on the city's waiting list, moved in after independent inspectors certified that the units met safety and energy-efficiency standards. While questions remain about the long-term durability of the materials, housing advocates say the method could help address chronic shortages if adopted at scale.",
