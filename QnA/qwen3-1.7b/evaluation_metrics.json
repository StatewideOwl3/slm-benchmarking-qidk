Under the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system, the San Diego area has been variously categorized as having either a semi-arid climate (BSh in the original classification and BSkn in modified Köppen classification) or a Mediterranean climate (Csa and Csb). San Diego's climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters with most of the annual precipitation falling between December and March. The city has a mild climate year-round, with an average of 201 days above 70 °F (21 °C) and low rainfall (9–13 inches [230–330 mm] annually).

      "question": "Who is an example of someone that states that affirmative action is another form of discrimination?",
      "model_answer": ".\n\nContext:\nSome commentators have defined reverse discrimination as a policy or practice in which members of a majority are discriminated against in favor of a historically disadvantaged group or minority.[non-primary source needed] Many argue that reverse discrimination results from affirmative action policies and that these policies are just another form of discrimination no different from examples in the past. People like Ward Connerly assert that affirmative action requires the very discrimination it is seeking to eliminate. According to these opponents, this contradiction might make affirmative action counter-productive. One argument for reverse discrimination is the idea that affirmative action encourages mediocrity and incompetence. Job positions would not be offered to the applicants who are the most qualified, but to applicants with a special trait such as a certain race, ethnicity, or gender. For example, opponents say affirmative action causes unprepared applicants to be accepted in highly demanding educational institutions or jobs which result in eventual failure (see, for example, Richard Sander's study of affirmative action in Law School, bar exam and eventual performance at law firms). Other opponents say that affirmative action lowers the bar and so denies those who strive for excellence on their own merit and the sense of real achievement. Opponents of affirmative action suggest that merit should be the primary factor considered in applying for job positions, college, graduate school, etc.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is an example of someone that states that affirmative action is another form of discrimination?\n\nassistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for an example of someone who states that affirmative action is another form of discrimination. The context mentions that some commentators define reverse discrimination as a policy where majority members are discriminated against in favor of a disadvantaged group. Then it says many argue that reverse discrimination results from affirmative action policies and that these policies are just another form of discrimination no different from examples in the past.\n\nSo the person mentioned here is \"many argue\" and they say that affirmative action policies are another form of discrimination. The example given is \"these policies are just another form of discrimination no different from examples in the past.\" The name isn't explicitly given, but the question is asking for an example of someone who makes that claim. The context doesn't name a specific person, but the phrase \"many argue\" suggests that the example is part of the general argument. However, the question asks for \"who is an example,\" so maybe the answer is the group of commentators mentioned. But the context doesn't name a specific individual.

      "question": "As an inhaler, what was epinephrine used to treat?",
      "model_answer": ".\n\nContext:\nBy the 1890s the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.\n\nQuestion:\nAs an inhaler, what was epinephrine used to treat?\n\nassistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what epinephrine was used to treat as an inhaler. I need to find the answer in the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a part that says: \"Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.\"\n\nSo the key part here is \"the acute treatment of asthma attacks\" and then \"nasal congestion.\" The question specifically mentions inhaler use, so the answer should be asthma attacks and nasal congestion. But the question is asking what it was used to treat, so the answer would be both. However, the context mentions both, so I need to check if the answer is precise.

      "model_answer": ".\n\nContext:\nWestern philosophy regarded emotion in varying ways. In stoic theories it was seen as a hindrance to reason and therefore a hindrance to virtue. Aristotle believed that emotions were an essential component of virtue. In the Aristotelian view all emotions (called passions) corresponded to appetites or capacities. During the Middle Ages, the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by scholasticism and Thomas Aquinas in particular. There are also theories of emotions in the works of philosophers such as René Descartes, Niccolò Machiavelli, Baruch Spinoza and David Hume. In the 19th century emotions were considered adaptive and were studied more frequently from an empiricist psychiatric perspective.\n\nQuestion:\nAlong with Descartes, Machiavelli and Hume, what notable philosopher developed a theory of emotions?\n\nassistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which notable philosopher, along with Descartes, Machiavelli, and Hume, developed a theory of emotions.

Wait, the question says \"along with Descartes, Machiavelli, and Hume,\" but the context only mentions Descartes, Machiavelli, Hume, and mentions Thomas Aquinas in the context of Aristotle and scholasticism. \n\nWait, the question is asking for a philosopher besides those three. The context says that in the works of philosophers like Descartes, Machiavelli, Spinoza, Hume, and Thomas Aquinas. But the question is asking for someone along with Descartes, Machiavelli, and Hume. So the answer would be Spinoza, since the context mentions Spinoza as another philosopher who developed a theory of emotions.

There is also theatre activity from the Yale School of Drama, which works through the Yale University Theatre and the student-run Yale Cabaret. Southern Connecticut State University hosts the Lyman Center for the Performing Arts. The shuttered Palace Theatre (opposite the Shubert Theatre) is being renovated and will reopen as the College Street Music Hall in May, 2015. Smaller theatres include the Little Theater on Lincoln Street. Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School also boasts a state-of-the-art theatre on College Street.

The user is asking for two additional major theatre houses in New Haven besides the Yale Repertory Theatre. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the context provided. The context mentions the Yale Repertory Theatre, Long Wharf Theatre, Shubert Theatre, Yale School of Drama's theatres, Lyman Center for Performing Arts, Palace Theatre being renovated, Little Theater on Lincoln Street, and Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School's theatre.\n\nSo, the question is about adding two more than Yale Repertory Theatre. The context lists Long Wharf Theatre and Shubert Theatre as separate entities. Those are definitely major theatre houses. The other ones mentioned are part of the Yale School of Drama, like Yale University Theatre and Yale Cabaret, which might be considered part of Yale, not separate major houses. Then there's the Lyman Center for the Performing Arts, which is a separate facility. The Palace Theatre is being renovated, so maybe that's not a current major house. The Little Theater on Lincoln Street and the Cooperative theatre are smaller ones. \n\nSo the answer should be Long Wharf Theatre and Shubert Theatre. Let me check again.

      "question": "What was the windmill used for?",
      "model_answer": ".\n\nContext:\nAdvances were made in irrigation and farming, using new technology such as the windmill. Crops such as almonds and citrus fruit were brought to Europe through al-Andalus, and sugar cultivation was gradually adopted by the Europeans. Arab merchants dominated trade in the Indian Ocean until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century. Hormuz was an important center for this trade. There was also a dense network of trade routes in the Mediterranean, along which Muslim countries traded with each other and with European powers such as Venice, Genoa and Catalonia. The Silk Road crossing Central Asia passed through Muslim states between China and Europe.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat was the windmill used for?\n\nassistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question.

Since the question is about the windmill's use, the answer is the part about irrigation and farming. The answer starts with \"using new technology such as the windmill\" and ends before the next sentence. So the span is from \"using new technology such as the windmill\" to the end of the",
