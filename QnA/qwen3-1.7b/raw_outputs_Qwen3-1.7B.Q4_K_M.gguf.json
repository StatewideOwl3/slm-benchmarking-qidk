The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued; St Augustine (following St Ambrose) feared that this invited the \"drunken\" practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor. Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying Feralia and Caristia in sufficient numbers for the Council of Tours to forbid them in AD 567. Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different. Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life. The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly relics, and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to \"new life\".\n\nQuestion:\nWhat group's burial practices over-lapped with the Roman's?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The question is asking which group's burial practices overlapped with the Roman's. The context says, \"In the later Imperial era, the burial and commemorative practises of Christian and non-Christians overlapped.\" So the answer should be \"Christian and non-Christian\" because that's the group mentioned as overlapping with the Roman's practices.\n\nI need to make sure I'm citing the exact part from the context. The sentence says \"Christian and non-Christians overlapped,\" so the span would be from \"Christian and non-Christians\" in the context. Let me check again. Yes, that's correct. The answer is definitely that group.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** Christian and non-Christians [end of text]\n\n\n",

The question is asking what hydrogen-lifted airships were called. I need to find the exact term mentioned in the context.\n\nThe context mentions that German count Ferdinand von Zeppelin promoted rigid airships lifted by hydrogen, which were later called Zeppelins. The first of them had a maiden flight in 1900. So the answer should be \"Zeppelins\" because that's the specific term given for those airships. I don't see any other terms mentioned in the context, so that's the only one.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** Zeppelins [end of text]\n\n\n",

The user is asking how many people were killed as a result of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake based on the provided context.\n\nLooking at the context paragraph, it states: \"killed 69,197 people and left 18,222 missing.\" The question is specifically about the number killed, so the answer should be the 69,197 figure. I need to make sure that this number is directly cited from the context and not inferred. The context explicitly mentions 69,197, so that's the exact span. The answer should start with ***ANSWER*** and include the number. No need to mention the missing people since the question is only about the killed ones. Alright, that's straightforward.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** 69,197 [end of text]\n\n\n",

The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to \"see\" more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by George Sperling (1963) using the \"partial report paradigm\". Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments,Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the \"whole report\" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow long does sensory memory take to store information?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Do not include commentary before that marker.\n\nuser\nYou will be given a context paragraph and a question.\nProvide the precise span, prefixed with ***ANSWER***.\n\nContext:\nSensory memory holds sensory information less than one second after an item is perceived. The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to \"see\" more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by George Sperling (1963) using the \"partial report paradigm\". Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments,Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the \"whole report\" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow long does sensory memory take to store information?\n\nassistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how long sensory memory takes to store information. The context says sensory memory holds sensory information less than one second after an item is perceived. So the key part here is \"less than one second.\" I need to make sure I cite that exact phrase.\n\nThe answer should be the span from the context that mentions the duration. The context states \"less than one second after an item is perceived.\" So the span would be from \"less than one second\" to the end of the sentence. But since the question is about how long it takes to store, the answer is that it's less than one second. I need to check if there's any other information in the context that might affect this. The rest of the context talks about experiments and capacity, but that's not relevant here. So the answer is definitely the part about the duration.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER***Sensory memory holds sensory information less than one second after an item is perceived. [end of text]\n\n\n",

The Air has been the best-selling ultra-portable in certain countries over Windows Ultrabooks, particularly the United States. While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest, the Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around subnotebook/ultraportable in regard to \"OS X experience, full keyboard, superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality, all-aluminum unibody construction\". The Air was among the first to receive Intel's latest CPUs before other PC manufacturers, and OS X has gained market share on Windows in recent years. Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States, although being one of the higher-priced competitors, though several Ultrabooks with better features were often more expensive than the MacBook Air. The competitive pricing of MacBooks was particularly effective when rivals charged more for seemingly equivalent Ultrabooks, as this contradicted the established \"elitist aura\" perception that Apple products cost more but were higher quality, which made these most expensive Ultrabooks seem exorbitant no matter how valid their higher prices were.\n\nQuestion:\nThrough 7/1/13, what percentage of all Ultrabook sales in the U.S. were MacBook Airs?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user is asking about the percentage of Ultrabook sales in the U.S. that were MacBook Airs through July 1, 2013.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a sentence that says, \"Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States.\" So the answer should be directly quoted from that sentence. The question is asking for the exact percentage, which is 56 percent. I need to make sure that the span is correct. The context mentions \"56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the U.S.\" So the answer is exactly that number. No need to infer anything else since the context provides it directly.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER***Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States.

The question is asking which South African city participated in the first public video-conference. The context mentions that in 1995, the first public videoconference between North America and Africa took place, linking a technofair in San Francisco with a techno-rave and cyberdeli in Cape Town. So the cities mentioned are San Francisco (USA) and Cape Town (South Africa). The question specifically asks about South African cities, so Cape Town is the answer here. The answer should be the span from \"Cape Town\" to the end of the sentence. Let me check the context again to make sure.

The user is asking about Spielberg's films since \"Sugarland Express\" that didn't have John Williams' music. \n\nFirst, I need to check the context provided. The context mentions that Spielberg collaborated with Williams on all his films except for Bridge of Spies, The Color Purple, and Twilight Zone: The Movie. So, the answer should be those three films. \n\nWait, the question says \"since Sugarland Express,\" which is the first film mentioned here. The context states that the collaboration started with The Sugarland Express, and the exceptions are Bridge of Spies, The Color Purple, and Twilight Zone: The Movie. So those three are the only ones without Williams' music. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other film mentioned. The context doesn't list any others, so the answer is those three. The user wants the precise span, so I should extract the exact film titles from the context.

Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his Austrian citizenship, as Austria does not usually allow dual citizenship. His request was granted, and he retained his Austrian citizenship. In 2005, Peter Pilz, a member of the Austrian Parliament from the Austrian Green Party, demanded that Parliament revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship due to his decision not to prevent the executions of Donald Beardslee and Stanley Williams, causing damage of reputation to Austria, where the death penalty has been abolished since 1968. This demand was based on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act that states: \"A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship, if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic.\" Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights) had indeed done damage to Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by referring to the fact that his only duty as Governor of California was to prevent an error in the judicial system.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich member of Austrian parliament wanted Schwarzenegger to lose his Austrian citizenship?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user is asking which member of the Austrian Parliament wanted Schwarzenegger to lose his citizenship.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a mention of Peter Pilz from the Austrian Green Party. He demanded that Parliament revoke his citizenship because of his support for the death penalty. The context says Pilz was a member of the Austrian Parliament and from the Green Party. The answer should be Peter Pilz. I need to make sure that's exactly what the context says. Yes, it mentions Pilz as a member of the Austrian Parliament from the Green Party. So the answer is Pilz.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** Peter Pilz [end of text]\n\n\n",

The user is asking what English players did after the ban following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions that after the ban, several top English players moved abroad. The exact phrase is \"several top English players had moved abroad.\" So the answer should refer to them moving abroad. The question is about their actions after the ban, and the context directly states that they moved abroad. There's no mention of specific destinations or reasons beyond moving abroad. Since the question is about what they did, and the context says they moved abroad, that's the precise span. I need to make sure not to add any extra information not in the context. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER***Several top English players had moved abroad. [end of text]\n\n\n",

Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, elders and deacons. Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity.\n\nQuestion:\nSoul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation what examples of what?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Do not include commentary before that marker.\n\nuser\nYou will be given a context paragraph and a question.\nProvide the precise span, prefixed with ***ANSWER***.\n\nContext:\nBaptists are individuals who comprise a group of Christian denominations and churches that subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and that it must be done by complete immersion (as opposed to affusion or sprinkling). Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, elders and deacons. Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity.\n\nQuestion:\nSoul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation what examples of what?\n\nassistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the examples of what in the context provided. The context mentions Soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation. \n\nSo, the question is asking what these terms are examples of. From the context, these are tenets of Baptist churches. The answer should point out that these are examples of the doctrines upheld by Baptist churches. The user wants the precise span, so I need to find the exact part of the context that mentions these tenets.\n\nLooking at the context again: \"Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation.\" The part after \"include\" lists these tenets. Therefore, the answer should be the span from \"soul competency (liberty)\" to \"autonomy of the local congregation,\" which are the examples of the tenets. \n\nI need to make sure that the answer is exactly the span mentioned in the context. The user wants the answer prefixed with ***ANSWER*** and to cite only what is supported by the context. So the answer is\n\n",

New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper. The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown (紐約華埠), in Brooklyn (布鲁克林華埠), and around Flushing, Queens (法拉盛華埠), are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County (拿騷縣) on Long Island (長島), as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas. In 2012, 6.3% of New York City was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island. A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese (Chaoxianzu (Chinese: 朝鲜族) or Joseonjok (Hangul: 조선족)) is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New York City is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens. Koreans made up 1.2% of the city's population, and Japanese 0.3%. Filipinos were the largest Southeast Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese, who made up 0.2% of New York City's population in 2010. Indians are the largest South Asian group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively. Queens is the preferred borough of settlement for Asian Indians, Koreans, and Filipinos, as well as Malaysians and other Southeast Asians; while Brooklyn is receiving large numbers of both West Indian as well as Asian Indian immigrants.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat percentage of the New York City population is Japanese?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The question is asking for the percentage of the New York City population that is Japanese.\n\nLooking at the context paragraph, I need to find where it mentions Japaneses. Let me scan through the text again. \n\nThe context says: \"Koreans made up 1.2% of the city's population, and Japanese 0.3%.\" So directly under the Japanese part, it states 0.3%. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of Japanese in the context. The rest of the paragraph talks about other groups like Chinese, Filipinos, etc., but the specific number for Japanese is clearly given as 0.3%. \n\nSo the answer should be 0.3%, and the span is the exact part mentioning that. No need to include anything else since the context provides that specific figure.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** \"Japanese 0.3%.\" [end of text]\n\n\n",

After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, leaving subsequent smaller armed engagements following in its wake, the city became the British military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees, as well as escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces evacuated at the close of the war in 1783, they transported 3,000 freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia. They resettled other freedmen in England and the Caribbean.\n\nQuestion:\nWhen did the English army start to retreat and evacuate NYC during the Battle of Long Island?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user is asking when the English army started to retreat and evacuate NYC during the Battle of Long Island.\n\nLooking at the context, it says the British forces evacuated at the close of the war in 1783. The battle was in 1776, but the evacuation happened after the war. So the evacuation happened in 1783. The question is about when they started to retreat, which would be around the same time the war ended. The context mentions the evacuation happened at the close of the war, so the answer should be 1783. I need to make sure I cite the exact part about the evacuation date.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** The English army started to retreat and evacuate NYC during the Battle of Long Island at the close of the war in 1783.

The question is asking what creature's needs were traditionally seen to at inns, aside from human beings. The context mentions that inns used to provide stabling and fodder for the traveller's horse(s) and on some roads fresh horses for the mail coach. So the animals mentioned here are horses. The answer should be the span mentioning horses. Let me check the context again to make sure. Yes, it says \"stabling and fodder for the traveller's horse(s)\" and \"fresh horses for the mail coach.\" So the answer is horses. The answer starts with ***ANSWER*** and the span is the part about horses.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** the context states that inns traditionally provided stabling and fodder for the traveller's horse(s) and fresh horses for the mail coach. Thus, the answer is horses. [end of text]\n\n\n",

Goodison Park, like all major English football grounds since the recommendations of the Taylor Report were implemented, is now an all-seater and only holds just under 40,000, meaning it is unlikely that this attendance record will ever be broken at Goodison. Everton's record transfer paid was to Chelsea for Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku for a sum of £28m.

The user is asking about the number of fans in attendance during Everton's match against Liverpool on September 18, 1948. The context says the record attendance was 78,299. So the answer should be exactly that number. I need to make sure I'm citing the correct part of the context. The sentence starts with \"The record attendance for an Everton home match is 78,299...\" so the span is from \"78,299\" to the end of the sentence. No other numbers are mentioned, so that's the only figure here. The question is straightforward, and the answer is directly provided in the context. I don't need to add anything else. Just extract the exact number and put it in the ANSWER block.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** The record attendance for an Everton home match is 78,299... 78,299 [end of text]\n\n\n",

The question is asking which organization General Ashcroft assigned as the lead organization in terrorism investigations. The context mentions that after the September 11 attacks, the Attorney General Ashcroft assigned the FBI as the designated lead organization in terrorism investigations. The key part here is \"the FBI.\" The context also talks about ICE-HSI and the FBI being part of the Joint Terrorism Task Force, but the specific answer here is the FBI. I need to make sure I'm not confusing any other agencies. The answer should be the FBI, and the span would be the exact phrase from the context. Let me check again. The context says \"the FBI as the designated lead organization...\" so the answer is FBI.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** the FBI [end of text]\n\n\n",

Go to the battlefield firmly confident of victory, and you will come home with no wounds whatever. Engage in combat fully determined to die and you will be alive; wish to survive in the battle and you will surely meet death. When you leave the house determined not to see it again you will come home safely; when you have any thought of returning you will not return.

The question is asking what Uesugi encouraged. The context mentions that Uesugi Kenshin advocated the \"way of the warrior as death.\" The quote from Suzuki talks about embracing death in battle, going confidently to fight, and not thinking the world is always changing. So, the key here is the \"way of the warrior as death.\" The answer should be the part about encouraging warriors to embrace death in battle. The span would be the exact phrase from the context. Let me check the context again to make sure. Yes, the sentence says \"advocated the 'way of the warrior as death'.\" So the answer is that he encouraged warriors to embrace death in battle. The span is from \"the 'way of the warrior as death'\" in the context.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** the \"way of the warrior as death\" [end of text]\n\n\n",

The user is asking about the climate classification of San Diego. The context mentions that under the Köppen–Geiger system, San Diego is categorized as either a semi-arid climate (BSh in original, BSkn in modified) or a Mediterranean climate (Csa and Csb). So the answer should specify both possibilities. But the question is asking for the type, so maybe the answer is both? Wait, the question is phrased as \"What type of climate is San Diego classified as having?\" So the answer would include both possibilities. But the user wants the precise span. Let me check the context again. The context says \"variously categorized as having either a semi-arid climate (BSh in the original classification and BSkn in modified Köppen classification) or a Mediterranean climate (Csa and Csb).\" So the answer should be both, but the user might want the exact span. The answer would be the part that mentions both classifications. So the answer is \"San Diego's climate is classified as either a semi-arid climate (BSh in the original classification and BSkn in modified Köppen classification) or a Mediterranean climate (Csa and Csb).\" But the user wants the\n\n",

The user is asking how many pigs died in Sichuan. I need to find the specific number from the context.\n\nLooking at the context paragraph: \"In the Sichuan province a million pigs died out of 60 million total.\" So the answer is directly stated as 1 million. I should check if there's any other number mentioned, but the question is specifically about pigs, so that's the figure. No need to infer anything else. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** The context states that a million pigs died in Sichuan. [end of text]\n\n\n",

The context says that during the year of active service, a conscripted soldier could serve under the Minister of the Guards in the capital. The question is asking which Minister they could serve under. So the answer should be the Minister of the Guards. I need to make sure I'm citing the exact part from the context. The context mentions \"under the Minister of the Guards in the capital.\" So the span would be from \"under the Minister of the Guards in the capital\" in the context. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** under the Minister of the Guards in the capital [end of text]\n\n\n",

Against Madero's wishes, Orozco and Villa fought for and won Ciudad Juárez. After militias loyal to Madero defeated the Mexican federal army, on May 21, 1911, Madero signed the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez with Díaz. It required that Díaz abdicate his rule and be replaced by Madero. Insisting on a new election, Madero won overwhelmingly in late 1911, and he established a liberal democracy and received support from the United States and popular leaders such as Orozco and Villa. Orozco eventually became disappointed with the Madero's government and led a rebellion against him. He organized his own army, called \"Orozquistas\"—also called the Colorados (\"Red Flaggers\")—after Madero refused to agree to social reforms calling for better working hours, pay and conditions.

The question is asking what name Orozco's army was called. I need to find the relevant part in the context.\n\nThe context says: \"Orozco eventually became disappointed with the Madero's government and led a rebellion against him. He organized his own army, called 'Orozquistas—also called the Colorados (\"Red Flaggers\")—after Madero refused to agree to social reforms...\" \n\nSo here, it explicitly states that his army was called \"Orozquistas—also called the Colorados.\" The answer should be the span mentioning \"Orozquistas—also called the Colorados.\" The user wants the precise span, so I need to make sure I include the exact text. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER***Orozquistas—also called the Colorados (\"Red Flaggers\") [end of text]\n\n\n",

The user is asking where the 1952 Olympics were held. I need to check the context for that information.\n\nLooking at the context paragraph, it mentions \"the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.\" So the answer should be Helsinki. The span is the part that says \"1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.\" I need to make sure that's exactly what's in the context. Yes, that's correct. No other details about Helsinki here, so the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki [end of text]\n\n\n",

He served as an executive producer for the 1997 film Men in Black, and its sequels, Men in Black II and Men in Black III. In 2005, he served as a producer of Memoirs of a Geisha, an adaptation of the novel by Arthur Golden, a film to which he was previously attached as director. In 2006, Spielberg co-executive produced with famed filmmaker Robert Zemeckis a CGI children's film called Monster House, marking their eighth collaboration since 1990's Back to the Future Part III. He also teamed with Clint Eastwood for the first time in their careers, co-producing Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima with Robert Lorenz and Eastwood himself. He earned his twelfth Academy Award nomination for the latter film as it was nominated for Best Picture. Spielberg served as executive producer for Disturbia and the Transformers live action film with Brian Goldner, an employee of Hasbro. The film was directed by Michael Bay and written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and Spielberg continued to collaborate on the sequels, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Transformers: Dark of the Moon. In 2011, he produced the J. J. Abrams science fiction thriller film Super 8 for Paramount Pictures.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich studio produced 'Super 8'?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The question is asking which studio produced 'Super 8'. I need to find the answer in the context provided.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a sentence that says: \"Spielberg produced the J. J. Abrams science fiction thriller film Super 8 for Paramount Pictures.\" So the studio here is Paramount Pictures. The answer should be the exact span from the context. The user wants the precise span, so I need to extract that part. The answer is \"Paramount Pictures\" based on the sentence. Let me double-check to make sure there's no other studio mentioned. No, that's the only mention. So the answer is Paramount Pictures.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER***Paramount Pictures [end of text]\n\n\n",

People like Ward Connerly assert that affirmative action requires the very discrimination it is seeking to eliminate. According to these opponents, this contradiction might make affirmative action counter-productive. One argument for reverse discrimination is the idea that affirmative action encourages mediocrity and incompetence. Job positions would not be offered to the applicants who are the most qualified, but to applicants with a special trait such as a certain race, ethnicity, or gender. For example, opponents say affirmative action causes unprepared applicants to be accepted in highly demanding educational institutions or jobs which result in eventual failure (see, for example, Richard Sander's study of affirmative action in Law School, bar exam and eventual performance at law firms). Other opponents say that affirmative action lowers the bar and so denies those who strive for excellence on their own merit and the sense of real achievement. Opponents of affirmative action suggest that merit should be the primary factor considered in applying for job positions, college, graduate school, etc.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is an example of someone that states that affirmative action is another form of discrimination?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The question is asking for an example of someone who states that affirmative action is another form of discrimination. The context mentions that some commentators define reverse discrimination as a policy where majority members are discriminated against in favor of a disadvantaged group. Then it says many argue that reverse discrimination results from affirmative action policies and that these policies are just another form of discrimination no different from examples in the past.\n\nSo the person mentioned here is \"many argue\" and they say that affirmative action policies are another form of discrimination. The example given is \"these policies are just another form of discrimination no different from examples in the past.\" The name isn't explicitly given, but the question is asking for an example of someone who makes that claim. The context doesn't name a specific person, but the phrase \"many argue\" suggests that the example is part of the general argument. However, the question asks for \"who is an example,\" so maybe the answer is the group of commentators mentioned. But the context doesn't name a specific individual. Wait, the question says \"who is an example,\" so maybe the answer is the group of commentators, but the context doesn't name a specific person. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the person \"many argue\" which is\n\n",

The question is asking who developed EMALS. I need to find the answer in the context provided.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a sentence that says, \"General Atomics, the developer of the EMALS, was cleared by the US government to give a technical demonstration to Indian Navy officers...\" So the answer should be General Atomics. I need to make sure that's the exact span mentioned. The context mentions \"the developer of the EMALS\" and identifies General Atomics as the developer. So the answer is General Atomics, and the span is from the part that says \"General Atomics, the developer of the EMALS, was cleared...\" \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of the developer elsewhere, but the context only mentions General Atomics here. So the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** General Atomics, the developer of the EMALS, was cleared by the US government to give a technical demonstration to Indian Navy officers, who were impressed by the new capabilities of the system.

The user is asking for two reasons why Galicia's rural areas have been largely abandoned. The context provided mentions that the rural population declined due to several factors. \n\nFirst, the context states that the rapid increase in population in major cities like A Coruña, Vigo, and others happened as the rural population decreased. One reason given is the decline of agriculture due to economic development and mechanization. That's one reason.\n\nAnother point mentioned is that the population moved to find jobs in main cities. So, the second reason would be the migration of people to urban areas for employment. \n\nI need to make sure I'm citing the exact parts of the context. The first reason is directly mentioned in the sentence about economic development and mechanization leading to abandoned fields. The second reason is the movement of people to find jobs in cities. \n\nI should check if there's any other reason mentioned, but the context only lists those two. So the answer should be those two reasons.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** The two reasons for the abandonment of Galicia's rural areas are economic development and mechanization of agriculture, leading to the decline of rural livelihoods, and the migration of population to find jobs in main cities.

These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a smear of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process, or by plasma-etch. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma. The etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat do the hole walls in two-layer PCBs have to be before they can be electroplated?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The question is asking what the hole walls in two-layer PCBs need to be before they can be electroplated. The context says that the hole walls can be made conductive and then electroplated with copper to form plated-through holes. So the answer should be \"conductive\" because that's what they need to be made before electroplating.\n\nWait, let me check again. The context specifically mentions \"made conductive\" before electroplating. So the span would be \"conductive\" and the answer is that they need to be conductive. Yeah, that's correct.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER***conductive [end of text]\n\n\n",

Arsphenamine was prepared as part of a campaign to synthesize a series of such compounds, and found to exhibit partially selective toxicity. Arsphenamine proved to be the first effective treatment for syphilis, a disease which prior to that time was incurable and led inexorably to severe skin ulceration, neurological damage, and death.[citation needed]\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is Amphetamine's market name?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user is asking about Amphetamine's market name. First, I need to check the provided context to see if there's any mention of Amphetamine or its market names.\n\nLooking at the context, the main subject is Arsphenamine, the first synthetic anti-infective drug developed by Ehrlich. The context talks about Salvarsan as the commercial name. There's no mention of Amphetamine here. The question is about a different drug, Amphetamine, which isn't discussed in the given context. Since the context doesn't provide information on Amphetamine's market name, I can't extract that answer. The user's question is outside the scope of the provided context. Therefore, the answer isn't present in the context, so I should state that there's no information available.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** The context does not mention Amphetamine or its market name.

The user is asking when Beyoncé first made the Time 100 list. I need to check the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a mention that in 2013, Beyoncé made the Time 100 list. The sentence says, \"In 2013, Beyoncé made the Time 100 list, Baz Luhrmann writing...\" So the first mention is 2013. The question is about when she first made the list, so 2013 is the answer. I should confirm there's no earlier mention. The context doesn't say she was on the list before 2013. So the answer is 2013.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** In 2013, Beyoncé made the Time 100 list.

The question is asking who proposed an evolutionary concept of the gene as a unit of natural selection. The context mentions George C. Williams. Specifically, it says, \"He proposed an evolutionary concept of the gene as a unit of natural selection with the definition: 'that which segregates and recombines with appreciable frequency.':24\" So the answer should be George C. Williams. I need to make sure I cite the exact part from the context. The answer starts with ***ANSWER*** and includes the name and the citation. Let me check again to confirm there's no other mention of someone else. No, it's definitely Williams. Alright, that's it.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** George C. Williams [end of text]\n\n\n",

The resolution declared that messengers, as SBC delegates are called, \"unwaveringly denounce racism, in all its forms, as deplorable sin\" and \"lament and repudiate historic acts of evil such as slavery from which we continue to reap a bitter harvest.\" It offered an apology to all African-Americans for \"condoning and/or perpetuating individual and systemic racism in our lifetime\" and repentance for \"racism of which we have been guilty, whether consciously or unconsciously.\" Although Southern Baptists have condemned racism in the past, this was the first time the predominantly white convention had dealt specifically with the issue of slavery.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many Baptists registered for the meeting in Atlanta?\n\nassistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking how many Baptists registered for the meeting in Atlanta. The context says, \"More than 20,000 Southern Baptists registered for the meeting in Atlanta.\" So the answer should be the number 20,000. I need to make sure that's exactly what's in the context. The word \"more than\" is there, but the exact number is 20,000. So the answer is definitely 20,000. No other numbers are mentioned, so that's the only figure here.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER***More than 20,000 Southern Baptists registered for the meeting in Atlanta. [end of text]\n\n\n",

The user is asking which former CBS News correspondent graduated from BYU. I need to check the context for that information.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a mention of Elizabeth Smart-Gilmour, who is described as an American activist and contributor for ABC News, not CBS News. Then, further down, there's a line that says \"former CBS News correspondent Art Rascon.\" Wait, is Art Rascon mentioned as a former CBS News correspondent? Yes, in the context: \"former CBS News correspondent Art Rascon.\" And then it says he's part of BYU's media personalities. So the answer should be Art Rascon. Let me make sure there's no other names. The other names listed are Sharlene Wells Hawkes and Jane Clayson Johnson, but they're not CBS News correspondents. So the answer is Art Rascon.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** Art Rascon [end of text]\n\n\n",

The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.\n\nQuestion:\nAs an inhaler, what was epinephrine used to treat?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The question is asking what epinephrine was used to treat as an inhaler. I need to find the answer in the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a part that says: \"Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.\"\n\nSo the key part here is \"the acute treatment of asthma attacks\" and then \"nasal congestion.\" The question specifically mentions inhaler use, so the answer should be asthma attacks and nasal congestion. But the question is asking what it was used to treat, so the answer would be both. However, the context mentions both, so I need to check if the answer is precise. The context says \"nasal congestion\" in the last sentence, and \"asthma attacks\" in the previous part. Since the question is about inhalers, the answer would be both. But the user wants the precise span. The context mentions \"nasal congestion\" in the last sentence. So the\n\n",

The user is asking what significantly increased the magnates' wealth based on the context provided.\n\nThe context says, \"Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which significantly increased their wealth.\" So the direct answer here is \"gifts from monarchs.\" I need to make sure that's exactly what's in the context. The rest of the paragraph talks about temporary leases and the anti-magnate movement, but the key point here is the gifts. The answer should be the exact span from the context. Let me check again. The question is about what increased their wealth, and the context clearly states \"gifts from monarchs\" as the cause. So the answer is straightforward. No need to include the rest of the paragraph. Just the part that directly answers the question.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER***Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which significantly increased their wealth. [end of text]\n\n\n",

The user is asking which notable philosopher, along with Descartes, Machiavelli, and Hume, developed a theory of emotions. The context mentions that in the 19th century, emotions were considered adaptive and studied from an empiricist psychiatric perspective. Wait, the question says \"along with Descartes, Machiavelli, and Hume,\" but the context only mentions Descartes, Machiavelli, Hume, and mentions Thomas Aquinas in the context of Aristotle and scholasticism. \n\nWait, the question is asking for a philosopher besides those three. The context says that in the works of philosophers like Descartes, Machiavelli, Spinoza, Hume, and Thomas Aquinas. But the question is asking for someone along with Descartes, Machiavelli, and Hume. So the answer would be Spinoza, since the context mentions Spinoza as another philosopher who developed a theory of emotions.

The user is asking for two additional major theatre houses in New Haven besides the Yale Repertory Theatre. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the context provided. The context mentions the Yale Repertory Theatre, Long Wharf Theatre, Shubert Theatre, Yale School of Drama's theatres, Lyman Center for Performing Arts, Palace Theatre being renovated, Little Theater on Lincoln Street, and Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School's theatre.\n\nSo, the question is about adding two more than Yale Repertory Theatre. The context lists Long Wharf Theatre and Shubert Theatre as separate entities. Those are definitely major theatre houses. The other ones mentioned are part of the Yale School of Drama, like Yale University Theatre and Yale Cabaret, which might be considered part of Yale, not separate major houses. Then there's the Lyman Center for the Performing Arts, which is a separate facility. The Palace Theatre is being renovated, so maybe that's not a current major house. The Little Theater on Lincoln Street and the Cooperative theatre are smaller ones. \n\nSo the answer should be Long Wharf Theatre and Shubert Theatre. Let me check again. The context says \"the Long Wharf Theatre, the Shub\n\n",

In this way, Project Gemini built up spaceflight experience for the pool of astronauts who would be chosen to fly the Apollo lunar missions.\n\nQuestion:\nProject Gemini helped recruit experienced people for which upcoming lunar missions?\n\nassistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which upcoming lunar missions Project Gemini helped recruit experienced people for. The context says that most novice pilots command later missions, and Project Gemini built up spaceflight experience for those who would be chosen for Apollo lunar missions.\n\nSo the key points here are that the astronauts who do the later missions are the ones who later go to the Apollo missions. The question is about the upcoming lunar missions, which would be the Apollo ones. The answer should refer to the span that mentions the Apollo lunar missions. The context specifically mentions \"the Apollo lunar missions\" in the sentence about the pool of astronauts. Therefore, the answer is the part that says \"the Apollo lunar missions\".\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** the Apollo lunar missions [end of text]\n\n\n",

The user is asking how many people live on Norfolk Island. I need to find the exact number from the context.\n\nLooking at the context paragraph: \"It has 1,796 inhabitants living on a total area of about 35 km2 (14 sq mi).\" So the number here is 1,796. The question is straightforward, and the answer is directly stated. I should make sure not to include any extra information. The answer should be the span from \"1,796 inhabitants\" onwards. Let me check again to confirm there's no typo. Yep, 1,796 is correct. No need to mention the area because the question is specifically about the number of people.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** It has 1,796 inhabitants living on a total area of about 35 km2 (14 sq mi).

The question is asking which religion has more followers than any other in the Western world. The context says Christianity is the dominant religion in the Western World, with 70% being Christians. Then it mentions specific percentages in different regions: 76.2% in Europe, 73.3% in Oceania, and 86.0% in the Americas, breaking down further into 90% in Latin America and 77.4% in North America.\n\nSo the key point here is that Christianity is the dominant religion in the Western World, and the numbers given support that. The question is asking for the religion with more people than any other, and the answer should be Christianity. The context explicitly states that Christianity is the dominant religion, so the answer is straightforward. I need to make sure I cite the exact part from the context that supports this. The sentence says \"Christianity remains the dominant religion in the Western World, where 70% are Christians.\" So the span would be from \"Christianity remains the dominant religion in the Western World, where 70% are Christians.\" And the answer is Christianity.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** Christianity remains the dominant religion in the Western\n\n",

It combines camp, vaudeville, and British music hall with May's guitar virtuosity. The album's second single, \"Now I'm Here\", a more traditional hard rock composition, was a number eleven hit in Britain, while the high speed rocker \"Stone Cold Crazy\" featuring May's uptempo riffs is a precursor to speed metal. In recent years, the album has received acclaim from music publications: In 2006, Classic Rock ranked it number 28 in \"The 100 Greatest British Rock Albums Ever\", and in 2007, Mojo ranked it No.88 in \"The 100 Records That Changed the World\".

The user is asking about the position of \"Killer Queen\" on the Billboard Hot 100. I need to find the exact number from the context.\n\nLooking at the context paragraph, it says: \"The single 'Killer Queen' from Sheer Heart Attack reached number two on the British charts, and became their first US hit, reaching number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100.\" So the answer is 12. I should make sure there's no other number mentioned for the same song. The rest of the paragraph talks about other singles, but the question is specifically about \"Killer Queen,\" which is clearly stated as number 12. No need to check other parts of the context. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 [end of text]\n\n\n",

The following chart demonstrates how widely the prevalence of homosexuality can vary depending on what age, location and component of sexual orientation is being assessed:\n\nQuestion:\nWhat will cause the amount of homosexuality to vary?\n\nassistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what causes the amount of homosexuality to vary. From the context provided, I need to find the relevant part.\n\nThe context mentions that prevalence rates vary based on age, culture, sex, and the component of sexual orientation being assessed. Specifically, it says assessing sexual attraction gives a higher prevalence than sexual behavior or identity. Also, different components like sexual attraction, behavior, or identity have different rates. So the factors causing variation are age, culture, sex, and the component of sexual orientation being assessed.\n\nThe question is about what causes the amount of homosexuality to vary. The answer should highlight these factors. The context explicitly states that prevalence varies depending on age, culture, sex, and the component of sexual orientation. So the answer would be those factors. I need to make sure to cite the exact parts from the context. The answer should be precise and start with ***ANSWER***.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER***  \nThe amount of homosexuality will vary depending on age, culture, sex, and the component of sexual orientation being assessed.

The user is asking about automotive brands in Portugal based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for mentions of automotive brands. The context starts by saying the industry is diversified with automotive companies like Volkswagen Autoeuropa and Peugeot Citroen. So those are two brands mentioned. Then it mentions Volkswagen Group's AutoEuropa plant in Palmela, which is part of their operations. So Volkswagen is definitely there. \n\nAre there any other brands? The context doesn't mention any other automotive brands beyond those two. It does mention Peugeot Citroen, which are both brands under the Volkswagen Group. So the answer should include Volkswagen Autoeuropa and Peugeot Citroen. \n\nI need to make sure the answer is precise and only uses the information from the context. The user wants the span prefixed with ***ANSWER***. So the answer would be the exact phrases from the context. Let me check again: \"Volkswagen Autoeuropa and Peugeot Citroen\" are the automotive brands mentioned. Yes, that's correct. No other brands are listed here.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** Volkswagen Autoeuropa and Peugeot Citroen [end of text]\n\n\n",

The question is asking what the Chinese Muslim community is called. I need to find the correct answer in the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a sentence that says, \"There is also a well established Chinese Muslim community (gya kachee), which traces its ancestry back to the Hui ethnic group of China.\" So the term in parentheses is \"gya kachee\". That should be the answer. I need to make sure that's the exact span mentioned. The context mentions \"gya kachee\" in the sentence, so the answer is that part. No other terms are mentioned for the Chinese Muslim community here. Yep, that's it.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** The Chinese Muslim community is called gya kachee. [end of text]\n\n\n",

Worsening weather forced the two armies to separate: the ships sailed for the safer anchorage of St. Cast, while the army proceeded overland. The tardiness of Bligh in moving his forces allowed a French force of 10,000 from Brest to catch up with him and open fire on the reembarkation troops. A rear-guard of 1,400 under General Dury held off the French while the rest of the army embarked. They could not be saved; 750, including Dury, were killed and the rest captured.\n\nQuestion:\nHow did the army get to the new anchorage location?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Worsening weather forced the two armies to separate: the ships sailed for the safer anchorage of St. Cast, while the army proceeded overland. The tardiness of Bligh in moving his forces allowed a French force of 10,000 from Brest to catch up with him and open fire on the reembarkation troops. A rear-guard of 1,400 under General Dury held off the French while the rest of the army embarked. They could not be saved; 750, including Dury, were killed and the rest captured.\n\nQuestion:\nHow did the army get to the new anchorage location?\n\nassistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the army got to the new anchorage location. The context says that after the weather worsened, the two armies separated. The ships sailed for the safer anchorage of St. Cast, while the army went overland. So the army moved overland, not by ship. The answer should mention that they went overland to St. Cast. I need to check the exact wording. The context says \"the army proceeded overland.\" So the span is \"proceeded overland.\" The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** The army proceeded overland to the new anchorage location of St. Cast.

The user is asking for someone else who was a prominent early adult contemporary radio artist along with the mentioned individuals: Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Johnny Mathis, Nat King Cole, and Perry Como.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions that the vocalists initially included Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Johnny Mathis, Connie Francis, Nat King Cole, Perry Como, and others. So Connie Francis is listed here. The question is asking for someone else who was part of the early adult contemporary radio artists. \n\nThe question states that the user wants the span prefixed with ***ANSWER***. So I need to find the exact part of the context that mentions Connie Francis. The context says, \"the vocalists consisted of artists such as Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Johnny Mathis, Connie Francis, Nat King Cole, Perry Como, and others.\" \n\nSo Connie Francis is listed here. The question is asking for someone along with the others mentioned, so Connie Francis would be the answer. The answer should be the span from the context that mentions Connie Francis. The context says \"Connie Francis, Nat King Cole, Perry Como, and others.\" So the span would be \"\n\n",

The question is asking where the House of the Black Madonna is located. I need to find the answer in the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, it says, \"The best-known Cubist building is the House of the Black Madonna in the Old Town of Prague built in 1912 by Josef Gočár...\" So the location is clearly mentioned as the Old Town of Prague. The answer should be the span from \"Old Town of Prague\" onwards. Let me check if there's any other mention, but no, that's the only part. So the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\n***ANSWER*** The House of the Black Madonna is located in the Old Town of Prague. [end of text]\n\n\n",
