Do not include commentary before that marker.\n\nContext:\nIn the later Imperial era, the burial and commemorative practises of Christian and non-Christians overlapped. Tombs were shared by Christian and non-Christian family members, and the traditional funeral rites and feast of novemdialis found a part-match in the Christian Constitutio Apostolica. The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued; St Augustine (following St Ambrose) feared that this invited the \"drunken\" practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor. Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying Feralia and Caristia in sufficient numbers for the Council of Tours to forbid them in AD 567. Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different. Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life. The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly relics, and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to \"new life\".\n\nQuestion:\nWhat group's burial practices over-lapped with the Roman's?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",
    "model_answer": "**ANSWER**\n**Explanation:**\nThe Roman burial practices were largely characterized by a focus on the deceased's dignity and the preservation of their souls. The Christian Church, while acknowledging the opportunity to offer food to the poor, did not strictly adhere to the Roman tradition. The emphasis was on the deceased's spiritual well-being and the preservation of their souls.",

Hydrogen provided the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by Henri Giffard. German count Ferdinand von Zeppelin promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called Zeppelins; the first of which had its maiden flight in 1900. Regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they had carried 35,000 passengers without a serious incident.

Do not include commentary before that marker.\n\nContext:\nSensory memory holds sensory information less than one second after an item is perceived. The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to \"see\" more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by George Sperling (1963) using the \"partial report paradigm\". Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments,Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the \"whole report\" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow long does sensory memory take to store information?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",

The Air has been the best-selling ultra-portable in certain countries over Windows Ultrabooks, particularly the United States. While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest, the Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around subnotebook/ultraportable in regard to \"OS X experience, full keyboard, superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality, all-aluminum unibody construction\". The Air was among the first to receive Intel's latest CPUs before other PC manufacturers, and OS X has gained market share on Windows in recent years. Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States, although being one of the higher-priced competitors, though several Ultrabooks with better features were often more expensive than the MacBook Air. The competitive pricing of MacBooks was particularly effective when rivals charged more for seemingly equivalent Ultrabooks, as this contradicted the established \"elitist aura\" perception that Apple products cost more but were higher quality, which made these most expensive Ultrabooks seem exorbitant no matter how valid their higher prices were.\n\nQuestion:\nThrough 7/1/13, what percentage of all Ultrabook sales in the U.S. were MacBook Airs?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",

One of Spielberg's trademarks is his use of music by Williams to add to the visual impact of his scenes and to try and create a lasting picture and sound of the film in the memories of the film audience. These visual scenes often uses images of the sun (e.g. Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, the final scene of Jurassic Park, and the end credits of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (where they ride into the sunset)), of which the last two feature a Williams score at that end scene. Spielberg is a contemporary of filmmakers George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, John Milius, and Brian De Palma, collectively known as the \"Movie Brats\". Aside from his principal role as a director, Spielberg has acted as a producer for a considerable number of films, including early hits for Joe Dante and Robert Zemeckis. Spielberg has often never worked with the same screenwriter in his films, beside Tony Kushner and David Koepp, who have written a few of his films more than once.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat are the only Spielberg films since Sugarland Express to not have music by John Williams?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",

Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his Austrian citizenship, as Austria does not usually allow dual citizenship. His request was granted, and he retained his Austrian citizenship. In 2005, Peter Pilz, a member of the Austrian Parliament from the Austrian Green Party, demanded that Parliament revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship due to his decision not to prevent the executions of Donald Beardslee and Stanley Williams, causing damage of reputation to Austria, where the death penalty has been abolished since 1968. This demand was based on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act that states: \"A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship, if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic.\" Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights) had indeed done damage to Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by referring to the fact that his only duty as Governor of California was to prevent an error in the judicial system.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich member of Austrian parliament wanted Schwarzenegger to lose his Austrian citizenship?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",

New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper. The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown (紐約華埠), in Brooklyn (布鲁克林華埠), and around Flushing, Queens (法拉盛華埠), are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County (拿騷縣) on Long Island (長島), as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas. In 2012, 6.3% of New York City was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island. A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese (Chaoxianzu (Chinese: 朝鲜族) or Joseonjok (Hangul: 조선족)) is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New York City is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens. Koreans made up 1.2% of the city's population, and Japanese 0.3%. Filipinos were the largest Southeast Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese, who made up 0.2% of New York City's population in 2010. Indians are the largest South Asian group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively. Queens is the preferred borough of settlement for Asian Indians, Koreans, and Filipinos, as well as Malaysians and other Southeast Asians; while Brooklyn is receiving large numbers of both West Indian as well as Asian Indian immigrants.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat percentage of the New York City population is Japanese?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",

After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, leaving subsequent smaller armed engagements following in its wake, the city became the British military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees, as well as escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces evacuated at the close of the war in 1783, they transported 3,000 freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia. They resettled other freedmen in England and the Caribbean.\n\nQuestion:\nWhen did the English army start to retreat and evacuate NYC during the Battle of Long Island?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",

The latter tend to provide alcohol (and, in the UK, soft drinks and often food), but less commonly accommodation. Inns tend to be older and grander establishments: historically they provided not only food and lodging, but also stabling and fodder for the traveller's horse(s) and on some roads fresh horses for the mail coach. Famous London inns include The George, Southwark and The Tabard. There is however no longer a formal distinction between an inn and other kinds of establishment. Many pubs use \"Inn\" in their name, either because they are long established former coaching inns, or to summon up a particular kind of image, or in many cases simply as a pun on the word \"in\", as in \"The Welcome Inn\", the name of many pubs in Scotland.\n\nQuestion:\nAside from human beings, what creature's needs were traditionally seen to at inns?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",

Japanese historian Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki describes Uesugi's beliefs as: \"Those who are reluctant to give up their lives and embrace death are not true warriors.... Go to the battlefield firmly confident of victory, and you will come home with no wounds whatever. Engage in combat fully determined to die and you will be alive; wish to survive in the battle and you will surely meet death. When you leave the house determined not to see it again you will come home safely; when you have any thought of returning you will not return. You may not be in the wrong to think that the world is always subject to change, but the warrior must not entertain this way of thinking, for his fate is always determined.\"\n\nQuestion:\nWhat did Uesugi encourage?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",

Against Madero's wishes, Orozco and Villa fought for and won Ciudad Juárez. After militias loyal to Madero defeated the Mexican federal army, on May 21, 1911, Madero signed the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez with Díaz. It required that Díaz abdicate his rule and be replaced by Madero. Insisting on a new election, Madero won overwhelmingly in late 1911, and he established a liberal democracy and received support from the United States and popular leaders such as Orozco and Villa. Orozco eventually became disappointed with the Madero's government and led a rebellion against him. He organized his own army, called \"Orozquistas\"—also called the Colorados (\"Red Flaggers\")—after Madero refused to agree to social reforms calling for better working hours, pay and conditions.

People like Ward Connerly assert that affirmative action requires the very discrimination it is seeking to eliminate. According to these opponents, this contradiction might make affirmative action counter-productive. One argument for reverse discrimination is the idea that affirmative action encourages mediocrity and incompetence. Job positions would not be offered to the applicants who are the most qualified, but to applicants with a special trait such as a certain race, ethnicity, or gender. For example, opponents say affirmative action causes unprepared applicants to be accepted in highly demanding educational institutions or jobs which result in eventual failure (see, for example, Richard Sander's study of affirmative action in Law School, bar exam and eventual performance at law firms). Other opponents say that affirmative action lowers the bar and so denies those who strive for excellence on their own merit and the sense of real achievement. Opponents of affirmative action suggest that merit should be the primary factor considered in applying for job positions, college, graduate school, etc.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is an example of someone that states that affirmative action is another form of discrimination?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",

Later on in August 2013 Vice Admiral RK Dhowan, while talking about the detailed study underway on the IAC-II project, said that nuclear propulsion was also being considered. The navy also evaluated the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), which is being used by the US Navy in their latest Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers. General Atomics, the developer of the EMALS, was cleared by the US government to give a technical demonstration to Indian Navy officers, who were impressed by the new capabilities of the system. The EMALS enables launching varied aircraft including unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV). The aim is to have a total of three aircraft carriers in service, with two fully operational carriers and the third in refit.\n\nQuestion:\nWho developed EMALS?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",

Keep every answer precise, cite only what is supported by the provided context, and never guess. To help with downstream evaluation, always demarcate the start of your final response with the literal token ***ANSWER*** followed immediately by the short answer. Do not include commentary before that marker.\n\nContext:\nThe hole walls for boards with two or more layers can be made conductive and then electroplated with copper to form plated-through holes.  These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a smear of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process, or by plasma-etch. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma. The etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat do the hole walls in two-layer PCBs have to be before they can be electroplated?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",
    "model_answer": "**ANSWER**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe hole walls in two-layer PCBs have a specific requirement of being *before* the holes can be electroplated. This is because the high-temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system, while not directly damaging the copper layers, can also cause a significant reduction in the conductivity of the holes. This is because the holes are designed to be *very* small, typically only a few nanometers in diameter. This small size makes it difficult to effectively create a strong, stable connection, which is crucial for the high-reliability properties of the board. Silver (Ag) is a common and relatively inexpensive metal that is inert under normal conditions, but it is also susceptible to corrosion. Therefore, the need for a small hole wall is a fundamental requirement for the high-reliability properties of a two-layer PCB.\n\n**Further Considerations:**\n\n*   **Effectiveness:** The effectiveness of the hole wall depends on several factors:\n    *   **Thickness:** A smaller hole wall generally provides a stronger and more stable connection.\n    *   **Material:** The material of the hole wall (e.g., silver) can influence its conductivity.\n    *   **Presence of other materials:**",

The drug was given the commercial name Salvarsan. Ehrlich, noting both the general toxicity of arsenic and the selective absorption of certain dyes by bacteria, hypothesized that an arsenic-containing dye with similar selective absorption properties could be used to treat bacterial infections. Arsphenamine was prepared as part of a campaign to synthesize a series of such compounds, and found to exhibit partially selective toxicity. Arsphenamine proved to be the first effective treatment for syphilis, a disease which prior to that time was incurable and led inexorably to severe skin ulceration, neurological damage, and death.[citation needed]\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is Amphetamine's market name?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",

Do not include commentary before that marker.\n\nContext:\nBy the 1890s the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.\n\nQuestion:\nAs an inhaler, what was epinephrine used to treat?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",
    "model_answer": "**ANSWER**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nEpinephrine was a potent anesthetic and anti-inflammatory agent, used to treat a variety of conditions, including asthma attacks, respiratory distress, and even certain types of cancer. It was particularly effective for acute respiratory distress, which was a common complication of asthma. The act of injecting it into the lungs, while not directly lethal to the body, was a relatively safe and non-invasive method of administering it. The specific use of epinephrine in the context of asthma was a specific and often difficult-to-control condition. The \"Purine\" designation in the context of the active compound suggests that the active substance was a specific, low-potency purine, which could be metabolized into its various active forms, including the potent form of epinephrine. This specific purine was a significant benefit for the patient, as it was a relatively safe and non-invasive treatment.\n\n**Further Considerations:**\n\n*   **Specificity:** The \"Purine\" designation in the context of the active compound is a key feature that makes it a valuable tool for the patient.

In stoic theories it was seen as a hindrance to reason and therefore a hindrance to virtue. Aristotle believed that emotions were an essential component of virtue. In the Aristotelian view all emotions (called passions) corresponded to appetites or capacities. During the Middle Ages, the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by scholasticism and Thomas Aquinas in particular. There are also theories of emotions in the works of philosophers such as René Descartes, Niccolò Machiavelli, Baruch Spinoza and David Hume. In the 19th century emotions were considered adaptive and were studied more frequently from an empiricist psychiatric perspective.\n\nQuestion:\nAlong with Descartes, Machiavelli and Hume, what notable philosopher developed a theory of emotions?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",

Three major national museums are there: the Victoria and Albert Museum (for the applied arts), the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. The National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's most extensive collection of portraits. The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art; in 2000 this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the National Portrait Gallery known for housing?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",

Do not include commentary before that marker.\n\nContext:\nAdvances were made in irrigation and farming, using new technology such as the windmill. Crops such as almonds and citrus fruit were brought to Europe through al-Andalus, and sugar cultivation was gradually adopted by the Europeans. Arab merchants dominated trade in the Indian Ocean until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century. Hormuz was an important center for this trade. There was also a dense network of trade routes in the Mediterranean, along which Muslim countries traded with each other and with European powers such as Venice, Genoa and Catalonia. The Silk Road crossing Central Asia passed through Muslim states between China and Europe.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat was the windmill used for?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",
    "model_answer": "**ANSWER**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe windmill was a significant technological advancement that significantly reduced the cost and time required to produce a large quantity of crops like almonds and citrus fruits. It was a crucial tool for the burgeoning economies of Europe and the Arab world.\n\n**Further Considerations:**\n\n*   **Specificity:** The question's focus was on the windmill, which was a relatively small, but important, device. The context highlights the importance of trade and the increasing importance of agricultural production.\n*   **Accuracy:** The question's accuracy depends on the specific context provided. For example, if the question was about the windmill's use in the Arab world, the context would specify the specific type of crop it was used for.\n*   **Uncertainty:** The question's lack of specific details could be interpreted in different ways. For example, if the question was about the windmill's impact on the Arab world, it could be interpreted as a statement about the windmill's role in the Arab world.\n*   **Potential for Misinterpretation:** The question could be a simple test of recall, but it could also be a more nuanced question requiring a deeper understanding of the windmill's capabilities and its impact on the Arab",

Depending on subject's age, culture and sex, the prevalence rates of homosexuality vary depending on which component of sexual orientation is being assessed: sexual attraction, sexual behavior, or sexual identity. Assessing sexual attraction will yield the greatest prevalence of homosexuality in a population whereby the proportion of individuals indicating they are same sex attracted is two to three times greater than the proportion reporting same sex behavior or identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Furthermore, reports of same sex behavior usually exceed those of gay, lesbian, or bisexual identification.

Worsening weather forced the two armies to separate: the ships sailed for the safer anchorage of St. Cast, while the army proceeded overland. The tardiness of Bligh in moving his forces allowed a French force of 10,000 from Brest to catch up with him and open fire on the reembarkation troops. A rear-guard of 1,400 under General Dury held off the French while the rest of the army embarked. They could not be saved; 750, including Dury, were killed and the rest captured.\n\nQuestion:\nHow did the army get to the new anchorage location?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n",
