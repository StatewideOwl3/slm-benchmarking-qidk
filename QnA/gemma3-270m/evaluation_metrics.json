Amazingly, there was only 1 injury at this game-Tom Fleetwood was hit on the head by a coin thrown from the crowd whilst he marched around the perimeter with St Edward's Orphanage Band, playing the cornet. Goodison Park, like all major English football grounds since the recommendations of the Taylor Report were implemented, is now an all-seater and only holds just under 40,000, meaning it is unlikely that this attendance record will ever be broken at Goodison. Everton's record transfer paid was to Chelsea for Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku for a sum of £28m.

In 2005, he served as a producer of Memoirs of a Geisha, an adaptation of the novel by Arthur Golden, a film to which he was previously attached as director. In 2006, Spielberg co-executive produced with famed filmmaker Robert Zemeckis a CGI children's film called Monster House, marking their eighth collaboration since 1990's Back to the Future Part III. He also teamed with Clint Eastwood for the first time in their careers, co-producing Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima with Robert Lorenz and Eastwood himself. He earned his twelfth Academy Award nomination for the latter film as it was nominated for Best Picture. Spielberg served as executive producer for Disturbia and the Transformers live action film with Brian Goldner, an employee of Hasbro. The film was directed by Michael Bay and written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and Spielberg continued to collaborate on the sequels, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Transformers: Dark of the Moon.

      "model_answer": "**ANSWER**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe hole walls in two-layer PCBs have a specific requirement of being *before* the holes can be electroplated. This is because the high-temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system, while not directly damaging the copper layers, can also cause a significant reduction in the conductivity of the holes. This is because the holes are designed to be *very* small, typically only a few nanometers in diameter. This small size makes it difficult to effectively create a strong, stable connection, which is crucial for the high-reliability properties of the board. Silver (Ag) is a common and relatively inexpensive metal that is inert under normal conditions, but it is also susceptible to corrosion. Therefore, the need for a small hole wall is a fundamental requirement for the high-reliability properties of a two-layer PCB.\n\n**Further Considerations:**\n\n*   **Effectiveness:** The effectiveness of the hole wall depends on several factors:\n    *   **Thickness:** A smaller hole wall generally provides a stronger and more stable connection.\n    *   **Material:** The material of the hole wall (e.g., silver) can influence its conductivity.\n    *   **Presence of other materials:**",

      "model_answer": "**ANSWER**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nEpinephrine was a potent anesthetic and anti-inflammatory agent, used to treat a variety of conditions, including asthma attacks, respiratory distress, and even certain types of cancer. It was particularly effective for acute respiratory distress, which was a common complication of asthma. The act of injecting it into the lungs, while not directly lethal to the body, was a relatively safe and non-invasive method of administering it. The specific use of epinephrine in the context of asthma was a specific and often difficult-to-control condition. The \"Purine\" designation in the context of the active compound suggests that the active substance was a specific, low-potency purine, which could be metabolized into its various active forms, including the potent form of epinephrine. This specific purine was a significant benefit for the patient, as it was a relatively safe and non-invasive treatment.\n\n**Further Considerations:**\n\n*   **Specificity:** The \"Purine\" designation in the context of the active compound is a key feature that makes it a valuable tool for the patient.
